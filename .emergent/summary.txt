The AI engineer successfully guided the user through deploying a meat inventory application, Bano Fresh, facing several deployment challenges across Render, PythonAnywhere, and a self-managed Linux VPS. The core recurring technical hurdle was an SSL handshake failure between the FastAPI backend and MongoDB Atlas, initially on Render (due to Python 3.13.4 incompatibility), and later on the VPS. Despite platform-specific fixes, the underlying SSL issue persisted, eventually resolved on VPS by standard Python 3.11 setup combined with  and .

The AI then performed a major overhaul of the product and POS sections, implementing Main Categories, Derived Products, detailed inventory management (weight-based purchases, daily piece tracking), and updating the POS flow. A critical security fix was also applied to restrict user creation to administrators only, impacting both frontend and backend logic. The current state is that this new feature set is implemented, locally tested in the Emergent environment using a local MongoDB, and ready to be pushed to a  GitHub branch for deployment.

<product_requirements>
The Bano Fresh meat inventory app was initially a full-stack MVP with POS, receipt printing, vendor/customer management, stock alerts, JWT auth, and a modern UI. Enhancements included purchase functionality, product derivation, comprehensive reporting, and admin-only user creation. Deployment was targeted at Hostinger for frontend and initially Render for backend, later switching to a self-managed Linux VPS for the backend.

The recent major overhaul involved:
- Replacing the entire Product section.
- **Main Category Management (Admin Only):** Create/manage categories like Mutton, Chicken, Fish, Frozen.
- **Derived Product Management:** Create products under main categories, assign SKUs, set daily selling prices.
- **Inventory Handling:** Track inventory at Main Category level by total weight (mandatory) and optional pieces during purchase entry. Calculations are weight-based.
- **End-of-Day Pieces Tracking:** Manual entry for pieces sold, automatic deduction, display remaining pieces per category.
- **POS Section Update:** Cascading dropdowns (Main Category -> Derived Products), only Derived Products can be sold.
- **Dashboard:** Display current inventory levels (weight + pieces).
- **Access:** Staff can view inventory; admin-only user creation.
- **Data Migration:** Start fresh for new inventory data.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (Atlas/Local), Motor, Pydantic, JWT, bcrypt, , , , .
- **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, Axios, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
- **Deployment:** Render (initial attempts with Dockerfile), PythonAnywhere (brief attempt), Linux VPS (systemd, Nginx, SSH, UFW).
- **Authentication:** JWT with admin-only user management.
- **Troubleshooting:** SSL/TLS handshake issues, Python version compatibility, Nginx proxy configuration,  service management, environment variables.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : **Major refactoring.** Existing  models and related endpoints were removed. New Pydantic models (, , , , , etc.) and corresponding API endpoints were added to support category, derived product, weight-based inventory, and daily piece tracking. Admin user creation logic had an existing backend check. MongoDB connection logic was updated to use  for SSL compatibility.
-   : Updated  and  versions throughout, added  and . Removed .
-   : Modified to store  status in localStorage upon successful login.
-   : Updated  array to include new pages (, , , , ) and conditionally render Users and new inventory-related menu items based on  status from localStorage.
-   : Modified to enforce admin-only access and display a message for unauthorized users.
-   : Updated routing to include new pages and remove old  and  routes.
-   : Modified to include a new  displaying key inventory metrics.
-   : This file is deprecated or slated for removal in favor of new inventory management.
-   : This file is deprecated or slated for removal in favor of .
-    (New): Handles CRUD operations for product main categories.
-    (New): Manages derived products under main categories, including SKU and daily pricing.
-    (New): Facilitates purchase entries with total weight, optional pieces, and vendor selection.
-    (New): Allows manual input for end-of-day piece sales and tracking.
-    (New): Replaces the old POS with cascading dropdowns for main categories and derived products.
-   , : Created as templates for environment variables.
-   , , , , : New documentation files generated by the AI.

<pending_tasks>
- Configure SSL for the backend API on the VPS (using a subdomain like  and Certbot).
- Rebuild the frontend with the correct HTTPS backend URL ().
- Upload the updated frontend  folder to Hostinger.
- Fully test the new inventory management features end-to-end on the deployed application.
- Change the default admin password (/) for security.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a major new feature set for the Bano Fresh inventory application. This involved a complete overhaul of the product and POS sections, introducing Main Categories, Derived Products, detailed inventory tracking (weight and daily pieces), and an updated POS workflow.

**Backend ():**
- Existing product-related models and endpoints were replaced.
- New Pydantic models for , , , , , and updated  were added.
- Corresponding API endpoints for CRUD operations on these new models were implemented.
- The backend was restarted and verified for syntax errors (none found).

**Frontend (, , ):**
- New pages: , , , ,  were created.
-  was updated to include an .
-  was updated to include the new routes and remove the old product/POS routes.
-  was updated to include the new navigation items, organized with section headers, and the Users menu item was made conditional based on admin status.
-  was modified to store  in .
-  was protected with an admin check to prevent unauthorized access.

The changes were locally tested in the Emergent environment with a local MongoDB and confirmed to be working correctly. The application is now ready for deployment to the VPS. The AI has also restored the MongoDB Atlas connection string in  in preparation for VPS deployment. The immediate next step is to push these comprehensive changes to the  branch on GitHub.
