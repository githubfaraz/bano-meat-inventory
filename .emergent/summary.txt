The AI engineer successfully deployed and iterated on the Bano Fresh meat inventory application. Initially, it resolved complex VPS deployment issues, including missing virtual environments, dependencies, and service restarts, along with Nginx configuration for the FastAPI backend. Subsequently, it addressed functional bugs in the POS and Sales pages, implementing receipt printing and correcting data fetching. The AI also handled out-of-scope requests, guiding the user on WordPress setup, troubleshooting Nginx/PHP upload and timeout issues.

A significant phase involved redesigning the Inventory page, implementing a Daily Waste Tracking feature with FIFO inventory adjustment, and fixing timezone inconsistencies across the application. The AI then began implementing a batch of new requirements: adding Pieces as a sale unit for specific categories, correcting a frontend display bug (undefinedkg), and implementing admin-only edit/delete functionalities for purchase, daily pieces, and daily waste records, ensuring inventory adjustments. The work paused on a frontend runtime error in  after backend changes for the new requirements.

<product_requirements>
The Bano Fresh meat inventory app is a full-stack MVP focusing on POS, inventory, vendor/customer management, reporting, and JWT auth with admin-only user creation. The application has undergone a major overhaul to implement:
- **Main Category Management:** Admin-only CRUD for categories (Mutton, Chicken, Fish, Frozen).
- **Derived Product Management:** Create products under categories, assign SKUs, set daily selling prices, and now includes  (Weight, Package, Pieces) and .
- **Inventory Handling:** Track by total  and optional . Sales deduct from  using FIFO.
- **End-of-Day Pieces Tracking:** Manual input for pieces sold.
- **Daily Waste Tracking (NEW):** End-of-day entry for  which deducts from  using FIFO, and updates all relevant calculations.
- **POS Update:** Cascading dropdowns, only derived products can be sold, and a default 0% tax rate. Receipt printing is implemented.
- **Dashboard/Inventory Overview (NEW):** Summary of top 4 categories with current stock, total waste, and View Detail links for purchase/sale/waste history.
- **Access:** Staff view inventory, admin-only user creation, and now admin-only edit/delete for purchase, daily pieces, and daily waste records.
- **Timezone:** All timestamps adjusted to Asia/Kolkata.
- **Stock Alerts:** (Pending)

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (Atlas), Pydantic (v2), JWT, , , , , .
- **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, Axios, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, CRACO.
- **Deployment:** Linux VPS, Nginx, systemd, SSH, UFW, Hostinger (for frontend).
- **Inventory Logic:** FIFO for weight and pieces deduction.
- **Authentication:** JWT with admin roles.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Major refactoring for new inventory models (,  with /, , , ). Implemented CRUD for these, with FIFO deduction logic for sales/waste/pieces. Integrated  for Asia/Kolkata timezone and updated all datetime fields with  and Pydantic . Added admin-only edit/delete endpoints for , ,  and a stock alert endpoint.
-   : Added .
-   : Modified to include  dropdown and  input for derived products, with display logic for undefinedkg bug fixed.
-   : Default tax rate set to 0%.  logic updated to handle  or  quantities based on product's .
-    (New): Page for end-of-day waste entry, simplified to a single  input. Integrated with backend to adjust inventory.
-   : Redesigned from a simple form to a 4-box category overview with View Details leading to tabs for Purchase, Waste, and Sales history.
-   : Updated routing to include .
-   : Updated navigation to include  and removed LEGACY sections.
-   : Updated  to .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implement stock alerts functionality.
- Troubleshoot and fix the  frontend error.
- Fully test the newly implemented frontend features for derived product units, POS tax, and edit/delete functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a batch of new requirements for the Bano Fresh application. This involved:

**Backend Modifications ():**
1.  **Timezone Fix:** The engineer continued to refine the timezone implementation, ensuring all  fields were correctly serialized with  timezone using Pydantic v2's  after previous attempts (custom JSON encoder, ConfigDict, custom JSONResponse) failed to consistently apply timezone information in API responses.
2.  **Edit/Delete Endpoints (Admin Only):** New API endpoints were added for administrators to edit and delete , , and  records. Crucially, the backend logic for these operations includes mechanisms to correctly adjust inventory levels (remaining weight/pieces) based on the changes, maintaining FIFO principles.
3.  **Derived Product Unit Support:** The  model and related validation/creation logic were updated to support different  options (Weight, Package, Pieces) and .
4.  **POS Sale Updates:** The  model and the POS sales creation logic ( endpoint) were adjusted to correctly handle sales in  in addition to , including appropriate inventory deduction.
5.  **Duplicate Code Removal:** Identified and removed duplicate weight deduction logic in the POS sales endpoint.
6.  **Stock Alert Endpoint:** A new endpoint for stock alerts was added (though the frontend implementation is still pending).
The backend changes were syntactically checked and the service was restarted, confirming it was running.

**Frontend State:**
The frontend was previously updated to include the  page, a redesigned  page, and changes in  and . However, after the latest backend updates, the user reported a new critical frontend error () causing a blank screen after login. This suggests an incompatibility or bug introduced by the recent backend model changes not yet fully reflected or correctly handled in the frontend. The  bug in Derived Products display and the Pieces sale unit display are likely related to the  and  changes that were being worked on.
