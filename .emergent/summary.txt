The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack inventory application for a meat seller. Initially, a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS were developed, incorporating JWT authentication, POS, and basic CRUD for products, vendors, and customers. The application was later enhanced with purchase functionality, product derivation from raw materials, and comprehensive reporting. Branding for Bano Fresh was integrated throughout.

A significant portion of the recent trajectory focused on deployment to Hostinger Linux shared hosting, which necessitated a hybrid approach: Render for the FastAPI backend (connected to MongoDB Atlas) and Hostinger for the static React frontend. The deployment process faced critical issues, primarily an SSL handshake failure between the Render-deployed backend and MongoDB Atlas, stemming from Render's use of Python 3.13.4, despite  specifying Python 3.11.0. This led to persistent debugging efforts, including modifying  for direct SSL configuration and updating environment variables. The AI also fixed a frontend  URL issue by correctly configuring . The current state involves resolving the persistent SSL error and ensuring the backend functions correctly on Render, before the final frontend upload to Hostinger.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web-based inventory application for a meat seller, Bano Fresh, managing raw chicken, mutton, livers, kidneys, boneless/curry-cut, and frozen items (kababs, sausages).

**Initial Requirements:**
*   **Core Functionality:** POS system, receipt printing (thermal printer compatible, PDF/HTML format), vendor management, customer management, stock alerts for low inventory.
*   **User Authentication:** JWT-based username/password.
*   **UI/UX:** Good frontend and ease of use, professional design, modern UI using Shadcn/UI, intuitive navigation, micro-animations, proper spacing, font guidelines (Manrope, Space Grotesk, Inter).

**Feature Enhancements:**
*   **Purchase Functionality:** Track raw materials (whole chicken/mutton) and derived products (boneless, curry cut, livers, kidneys) separately.
*   **Derivation Workflow:** Simple process: record purchase cost, then manually add derived products to inventory.
*   **Reporting:** Export reports for all data (Products, Purchases, Vendors, Customers, Sales) in all formats (Excel, CSV, PDF).
*   **Branding:** Rebrand the entire application to Bano Fresh with logo integration.
*   **User Management:** Remove public registration; implement an admin account (/) for creating new users.

**Deployment Requirements:**
*   Originally asked for deployment on Hostinger web hosting.
*   Later clarified: Hostinger Linux shared hosting, no additional purchases, preferring a free hybrid solution.
*   Finally, user chose Render for backend deployment.

The application has been built with a React frontend (Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS) and a FastAPI backend (MongoDB), integrated with a MongoDB Atlas database.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
*   : Contains FastAPI endpoints for authentication, products, vendors, customers, purchases, sales, and reports. It now includes logic for product derivation, admin user creation, and updated MongoDB connection parameters for SSL compatibility.
*   : Lists Python dependencies, including , , , , , , and recently .
*   : Stores backend environment variables like , , , .
*   : Specifies  for Render deployment to control Python version.
*   : Manages main React routing, defining paths for all application pages. Updated to include , , and  routes, and remove .
*   : Defines the application's structural layout and navigation sidebar. Updated to include links for new pages (, , ) and Bano Fresh branding.
*   : User login interface. Modified for Bano Fresh branding and to support admin-only login flow.
*   : (Removed) The public registration page was removed to implement admin-only user creation.
*   : Manages inventory. Updated to differentiate between raw materials and derived products, including relevant input fields and display badges.
*   : (New) Page for managing raw material purchases.
*   : (New) Page for generating various reports.
*   : (New) Admin interface for managing application users.
*   : Main HTML file. Modified to include Bano Fresh branding/logo and Google Fonts.
*   : Critical for frontend build. Stores  to point to the deployed backend.
*   : Created to handle client-side routing for React on shared hosting.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Resolve Render Backend SSL Issue:** Despite multiple attempts (Python version, direct SSL config in code, environment variables), the Render backend is still failing with an SSL handshake error when connecting to MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Verify Render Environment Variables:** Ensure all four critical environment variables (, , , ) are correctly set in the Render dashboard.
-   **Upload Frontend to Hostinger:** Once the backend is stable and verified, upload the production-built React frontend to Hostinger's  directory.
-   **Test End-to-End:** Perform a full end-to-end test on the deployed application, including admin login, user creation, product management, and POS functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical **** in the Render-deployed FastAPI backend. This error indicates a problem with the backend's connection to MongoDB Atlas, specifically related to SSL/TLS.

The core issue appears to be Render's persistent use of **Python 3.13.4** for the deployment environment, despite the  file (present in both the  directory and the repository root) explicitly specifying . Python 3.13.4 seems to have compatibility challenges with MongoDB Atlas's SSL configuration.

Multiple solutions were attempted:
1.  **Downgrading Python version:** The AI confirmed  was correct but Render ignored it.
2.  **Modifying :** Added  and  to  connection.
3.  **Modifying  environment variable:** Appended  to the connection string in Render's environment variables.

All these attempts failed, with Render logs consistently showing Python 3.13.4 being installed and the same SSL error.

The current work involves implementing a more robust SSL fix in  and  to explicitly use  for trusted SSL certificates and additional timeout parameters, aiming to bypass the platform-level Python version issue. The AI has just made these changes internally in the Emergent environment and is preparing to provide the user with the updated code to manually push to their GitHub repository, as the AI lacks direct GitHub push access.
