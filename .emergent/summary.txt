The AI engineer successfully progressed the Bano Fresh application through a challenging debugging and feature implementation phase. The work began by addressing a critical  frontend error and a persistent MongoDB SSL handshake issue. The AI systematically troubleshooted environment configurations, IP whitelisting, and Python dependency versions (e.g., , ), eventually resolving the connectivity issues after multiple iterations and user input regarding server environment.

Subsequently, the engineer focused on refining core inventory functionalities. This involved fixing the Derived Products page to handle missing  fields and conditionally displaying Pieces as a sales unit. Critical admin-only Edit and Delete functionalities were implemented across Purchase, Daily Pieces, and Daily Waste records, ensuring proper inventory adjustments. Frontend display bugs, such as undefinedkg and numeric values missing before kg, were resolved. The Add Purchase button and its associated dialog rendering logic were fixed, along with comprehensive error handling for API responses. Throughout, the AI provided deployment guidance and diagnostic scripts to assist the user in their Hostinger/Nginx server environment, effectively navigating and resolving deployment-specific frontend inconsistencies.

The Bano Fresh meat inventory app is an MVP for POS, inventory, vendor/customer management, and reporting with JWT admin auth. The recent overhaul aimed to:
- **Manage Categories/Products:** CRUD for main categories, derived products with  (Weight, Package, Pieces) and .
- **Inventory & Tracking:** Track  and , with FIFO deductions for sales/waste. Implement end-of-day pieces and daily waste tracking.
- **POS & Sales:** Updated POS for derived products, 0% tax, receipt printing.
- **Admin Access:** Admin-only user creation, and critical edit/delete for purchases, daily pieces, and daily waste records, with inventory adjustments.
- **Dashboard/Overview:** Summary of top 4 categories, stock, waste, and history links.
- **Timezone:** All timestamps in Asia/Kolkata.
- **Stock Alerts:** (Pending in initial requirements).
The recent work addressed a blank page error, fixed Pieces unit display, enabled admin edit/delete, resolved missing numeric values for stock, and fixed Add Purchase functionality and its dialog rendering.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was fixing critical frontend display and functionality issues reported by the user after deployment to their server. The latest work focused on resolving an Uncaught runtime errors: Cannot access AddPurchaseDialog before initialization error, which occurred when attempting to use the Add Purchase button. This was caused by the  component being defined *after* it was used within the  component.

The fix involved:
1.  **Restructuring :** Moving the  component definition to appear *before* its usage, resolving the initialization error.
2.  **Removing Duplicate Code:** Identifying and removing a duplicate definition of the  component to ensure clean and correct component rendering.

Prior to this, the engineer also provided a database cleanup script (Connecting to MongoDB...

The Add Purchase button's initial non-responsiveness and incorrect form pop-up were also addressed by correctly positioning the dialog rendering. All these fixes ensure the Add Purchase functionality now works as expected without errors.
