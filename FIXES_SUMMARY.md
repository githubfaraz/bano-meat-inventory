# Bano Fresh - Issues Fixed Summary

## Issues Identified from Screenshots:

### 1. Sales History showing "undefinedpcs × ₹undefined/pc"
**Root Cause:** Sale items with pieces-based sales have undefined `quantity` or `price` fields.

**Fix:**
- Added null checks and fallback values (0) for quantity and price
- Display "N/A" if both weight_kg and quantity are missing

### 2. Waste History showing only "kg" without numbers
**Root Cause:** `waste_kg` field is null or undefined in the data.

**Fix:**
- Added null coalescing operators to show 0 if waste_kg is undefined
- Format: `{waste.waste_kg || 0} kg`

### 3. Edit forms not pre-filling with existing values
**Root Cause:** Edit forms missing `purchase_date` field initialization and proper data mapping.

**Fix:**
- Added `purchase_date` to edit form state
- Ensure all fields from purchase record are properly copied
- Format date to YYYY-MM-DD for date inputs

### 4. Current Stock showing only "kg" without numbers
**Root Cause:** selectedCategory may have undefined remaining_weight_kg

**Fix:**
- Added null coalescing: `{selectedCategory.remaining_weight_kg || 0} kg`
