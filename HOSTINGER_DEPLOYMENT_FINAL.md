# Bano Fresh - Final Hostinger Deployment Guide

## âœ… BACKEND STATUS: LIVE!
Backend URL: https://bano-meat-inventory.onrender.com

## ðŸ“¦ FRONTEND FILES READY
All files are in: `/app/frontend/build/`

---

## STEP 3: Upload Frontend to Hostinger (5 minutes)

### Method 1: Using Hostinger File Manager (Easiest)

1. **Login to Hostinger:**
   - Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Open File Manager:**
   - Click on "Files" â†’ "File Manager"
   - Navigate to `public_html` folder

3. **Clear Existing Files:**
   - Select ALL files in `public_html` (if any)
   - Click "Delete"
   - Keep `.htaccess` if it exists and looks important for domain/email

4. **Upload Frontend Files:**
   
   You need to upload these files from `/app/frontend/build/`:
   
   âœ“ `index.html`
   âœ“ `asset-manifest.json`
   âœ“ `.htaccess` (IMPORTANT!)
   âœ“ `static/` folder (contains CSS and JS)

   **How to upload:**
   - Click "Upload" button in File Manager
   - Select files from your computer
   - OR drag and drop the build folder contents

5. **Verify File Structure:**
   
   Your `public_html` should look like this:
   ```
   public_html/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ asset-manifest.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ .htaccess
   â””â”€â”€ static/
       â”œâ”€â”€ css/
       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.775fe8dd.css
       â””â”€â”€ js/
           â””â”€â”€ main.47ff4948.js
   ```

### Method 2: Using FTP (Faster for Multiple Files)

1. **Get FTP Credentials:**
   - In Hostinger hPanel
   - Go to "Files" â†’ "FTP Accounts"
   - Note: Host, Username, Password, Port

2. **Connect via FTP Client:**
   - Download FileZilla: https://filezilla-project.org
   - Open FileZilla
   - Enter FTP details:
     - **Host**: ftp.yourdomain.com
     - **Username**: (from Hostinger)
     - **Password**: (from Hostinger)
     - **Port**: 21
   - Click "Quickconnect"

3. **Upload Files:**
   - Navigate to `public_html` on the right (server)
   - Delete existing files
   - Drag ALL files from `/app/frontend/build/` to `public_html`

## STEP 4: Test Your Application

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for files to process

2. **Visit your domain:**
   ```
   http://yourdomain.com
   ```
   or
   ```
   http://your-hostinger-subdomain.com
   ```

3. **You should see:**
   - âœ… Bano Fresh login page with logo
   - âœ… Clean, professional design
   - âœ… No errors in browser console

4. **Test Complete Flow:**
   - Register a new account
   - Login
   - Add a product
   - Create a vendor
   - Make a sale
   - Generate reports

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Blank page" or "Cannot find module"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded
- Check that `static/` folder is uploaded correctly
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### Problem: "Network Error" or "API not responding"
**Solution:**
- Check backend is running: https://bano-meat-inventory.onrender.com/api/
- Wait 30 seconds (Render free tier spins down after inactivity)
- Refresh page

### Problem: "404 on page refresh"
**Solution:**
- Ensure `.htaccess` file is in `public_html`
- Check if Apache mod_rewrite is enabled (usually is on Hostinger)

### Problem: Files not showing in File Manager
**Solution:**
- Click "Show Hidden Files" option in File Manager
- `.htaccess` starts with dot, so it's hidden by default

---

## Important Notes

1. **First Load May Be Slow:**
   - Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
   - Subsequent requests are fast

2. **Backend URL:**
   - Your frontend is configured to use: https://bano-meat-inventory.onrender.com
   - This is permanent and won't change

3. **SSL/HTTPS:**
   - If your domain has SSL, use `https://yourdomain.com`
   - If not, use `http://yourdomain.com`
   - Hostinger offers free SSL in hPanel â†’ SSL section

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Enable SSL (if not already):**
   - Go to Hostinger hPanel
   - Navigate to "SSL" section
   - Install free Let's Encrypt certificate
   - Update to use `https://yourdomain.com`

2. **Create First Admin Account:**
   - Register with your admin email
   - This will be your main account

3. **Add Initial Data:**
   - Add your vendors
   - Create product catalog
   - Set up customers
   - Start using POS!
