## Step 3: How to Upload Using GitHub Web Interface

### Method A: Upload Files One by One (Simpler)

For each file I provide below:

1. In your GitHub repository, click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
2. Enter the file name (e.g., `package.json`)
3. Copy-paste the content I provide
4. Scroll down, click "Commit changes"
5. Repeat for each file

### Method B: Upload Folders (Faster)

Since you're in Emergent, you'll need to:

1. Ask me for specific file contents
2. I'll provide each file's content
3. You create them in GitHub

---

## üìù Files Content:

I'll provide the content of each file below. Copy-paste into GitHub:

### File 1: package.json

```json
{
  "name": "bano-fresh-frontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.8.4",
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.5.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "sonner": "^2.0.3",
    "lucide-react": "^0.507.0",
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",
    "tailwind-merge": "^3.2.0",
    "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.11",
    "@radix-ui/react-select": "^2.2.2",
    "@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.1.4",
    "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^2.1.0",
    "@radix-ui/react-tabs": "^1.1.9"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "craco start",
    "build": "craco build",
    "test": "craco test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@craco/craco": "^7.1.0",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
    "postcss": "^8.4.49",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
  }
}
```

### File 2: .env.production

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://bano-meat-inventory.onrender.com
```

### File 3: tailwind.config.js

(I'll provide this next)

## Alternative: Simplified Approach

Since uploading all files individually is tedious, here's a **BETTER WAY**:

### Use This Pre-Made Template:

I can provide you with a **direct download link** to a complete template, OR:

**Just tell me**: 
- Do you have Git installed on your computer?
- Can you run terminal/command prompt commands?

If YES, I'll give you **much faster commands** to clone from a template!

---

## What You Need:

Tell me which approach you prefer:

**A)** Upload files one-by-one to GitHub (I'll provide all content)
**B)** Use Git commands on your computer (faster if you have Git)
**C)** I'll create a simplified starter template you can use

Which one works best for you?
